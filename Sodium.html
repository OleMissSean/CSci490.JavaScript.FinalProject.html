        <h1>Essential Mineral: Sodium</h1>
        <p id="p1">Your body needs sodium to maintain blood pressure and for normal nerve and muscle function. Getting too much sodium might cause blood pressure problems that can lead to health problems. It's easy to get enough sodium from the foods you eat and, in fact, it's more likely that you're getting more sodium than you need.</p><br>
         <h3>Good Sources of Sodium:</h3>
            <br><p id="p2">*(CONSUME WITH CAUTION)* - 
Though Sodium is an Essential Mineral you don't need a lot of it to perform these functions, and getting too much will put the electrolytes out of balance and lead to many health problems. The adequate intake for sodium is set at 1,500 milligrams per day for adults up to 50 years of age; 1,300 milligrams for adults from ages 51 to 70; and 1,200 milligrams per day after that. Sodium is found naturally in most of the foods you eat, at least in small amounts, with much larger amounts in soy sauce and processed foods. Processed foods are high in sodium if they contain salt for flavoring or sodium benzoate or sodium phosphate as preservatives.
