        <h1>Essential Amino Acid: Phenylalanine - Tyrosine</h1>
        <p id="p1">Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid (a building block for proteins in the body), meaning the body needs it for health but cannot make it. You have to get it from food. Phenylalanine is found in 3 forms: L-phenylalanine, the natural form found in proteins; D-phenylalanine (a mirror image of L-phenylalanine that is made in a laboratory), and DL-phenylalanine, a combination of the 2 forms. The body changes phenylalanine into tyrosine, another amino acid that's needed to make proteins; brain chemicals, including L-dopa, epinephrine, and norepinephrine; and thyroid hormones. Because norepinephrine affects mood, different forms of phenylalanine have been proposed to treat depression. Symptoms of phenylalanine deficiency include confusion, lack of energy, depression, decreased alertness, memory problems, and lack of appetite.
