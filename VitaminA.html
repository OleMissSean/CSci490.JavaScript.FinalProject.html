        <h1>Essential Vitamin: Vitamin A</h1>
        <p id="p1">Ways to get Sodium: (NOT REALLY)
You don't need a lot of sodium to perform these functions, and getting too much might put the electrolytes out of balance. The adequate intake for sodium is set at 1,500 milligrams per day for adults up to 50 years of age; 1,300 milligrams for adults from ages 51 to 70; and 1,200 milligrams per day after that. Sodium is found naturally in most of the foods you eat, at least in small amounts, with much larger amounts in soy sauce and processed foods. Processed foods are high in sodium if they contain salt for flavoring or sodium benzoate or sodium phosphate as preservatives.
