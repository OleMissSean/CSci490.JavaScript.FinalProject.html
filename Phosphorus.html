        <h1>Essential Mineral: Phosphorus</h1>
        <p id="p1">Phosphorus is an essential nutrient required for proper cell functioning, regulation of calcium, strong bones and teeth, and for making ATP (adenosine triphosphate) a molecule which provides energy to our cells. A deficiency in phosphorus can lead to lowered appetite, anemia, muscle pain, improper bone formation (rickets), numbness, and a weakened immune system. Phosphorus is found in almost every food, and as such, deficiency is rare. Conversely consuming too much phosphorus causes the body to send calcium from the bones to the blood in an attempt to restore balance. This transfer of calcium weakens bones, and can cause calcification of internal organs, increasing risk of heart attack and other vascular diseases. Some scientific research suggests that phosphorus is more easily absorbed from meat products,4 and you can only absorb half of the phosphorus contained in plant foods. The amount of phosphorus absorbed differs from person to person. Nutrients from plant sources are optimal for health. The DV (Daily Value) for phosphorus is 1000mg.</p><br>
