        <h1>Essential Amino Acid: Threonine</h1>
        <p id="p1">Threonine is one of the 20 amino acids that constitute proteins. It is an essential amino acid and not synthesized by humans. Therefore, threonine has to be obtained from dietary sources. Threonine supports cardiovascular, liver, central nervous, and immune system function. Threonine aids in the synthesis of glycine and serine, two amino acids that help in the production of collagen, elastin, and muscle tissue. Threonine helps build strong bones and tooth enamel. It also speeds up wound healing after injury by boosting immune system. Threonine combines with the amino acids aspartic acid and methionine to help liver digest fats and fatty acids, which reduces accumulation of fat in the liver. An accumulation of fats in the liver can affect negatively its function. Threonine is useful in treating Lou Gherig’s Disease, also known as Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Research shows that symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), another disease that affects nerve and muscle, are alleviated with threonine treatment. Threonine is an immunostimulant, which promotes the growth of thymus gland.</p><br>
