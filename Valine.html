        <h1>Essential Amino Acid: Valine</h1>
        <p id="p1">Valine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that works with the other two BCAAs, isoleucine and leucine, to promote normal growth, repair tissues, regulate blood sugar, and provide the body with energy. Valine helps stimulate the central nervous system, and is needed for proper mental functioning. Valine helps prevent the breakdown of muscle by supplying the muscles with extra glucose for energy production during intense physical activity. Valine also helps remove potentially toxic excess nitrogen from the liver, and is able to transport nitrogen to other tissues in the body as needed. Valine may help treat liver and gallbladder disease, as well as damage to these organs caused by alcoholism and drug abuse. Valine may help treat or even reverse hepatic encephalopathy, or alcohol-related brain damage. As an essential amino acid, valine can only be obtained through food sources, as your body isn't capable of synthesizing the amino acid on its own. The recommended dose is 23-26 mg of valine for every kilogram of body weight. Identifying foods rich in valine will ensure that you are maintaining your recommended daily intake.</p><br>
